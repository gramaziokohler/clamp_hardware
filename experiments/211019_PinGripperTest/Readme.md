Pin Gripper Hole Drilling Test

The purpose of this test is to check if the pin gripper system work with the drilled holes. In particular we would like to validate the drill hole spacing and angles.

##  Setup: Drilling

The drilling setup uses a 3D printed grill guide, the angle and separation of the holes can be seen in the drawing. The central 18mm hole is also drilled even though no left-in screw is used in the test.

## Setup: Pin Gripper Pins

A partially assembled clamp is used. One bronze and one steel pin (has a nut for more leverage) was used. They are manually rotated by hand holding onto the shaft, no pliers were used.

## Result

The clamping mechanism reached reasonable tightness at around 25mm extension (measured parallel to the main screw), it is also possible to force both screws to 30 mm extension by force, although I think this is not necessary in practice. 

Repeated use of the same hole shows some wear, probably by local crushing. On subsequent runs, both screws can be easily extended to 30mm extension, clamping force is still reasonable.

## Conclusion

I believe it is perhaps best to drill the diagonal holes manually in the production run. The accuracy I have achieved in this manual drill guide is rather high due to the precisely made drill guide and it is being clamped accurately to the wood.

I'm not sure if the CNC fabricator is willing to fine tune the machine for us to achieve similar results.
